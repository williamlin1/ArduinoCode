# ArduinoCode
This houses Arduino Code for Ceiling Robot
All the old library stuff is old and doesn't work that well, the only libraries you really need are the AFMotor one and the USBHost shield, the new one. Some of the old libraries are still needed to compile but you can get rid of those
I was intending the ERAD file to have the ones that work but right now NewLibraryCode is the one that has stuff that works
Uses the old V1 motor shield for arduino with DC Motor on port 1
